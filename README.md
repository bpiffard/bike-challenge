# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to anaylze Citi bank's bike sharing service in New York City. I sought to answer questions such as, how successful does it seem, who is the customer base, and how were the bikes being used? This analysis is meant to suggest whether or not bike sharing is a viable business.

# Results

![A line graph of the the average bike trip duration that peaks at the beginning of the first hour and declines to near zero from hour 2 on](https://github.com/bpiffard/bike-challenge/blob/main/Images/TripDuration.png)

Most rides do not last longer than an hour suggesting that these rides are for commuting reasons and not for long-distance endurance exercise.

![A line graph similar to the one above that shows trip duration by gender. There are no noticeable differences between genders, only that male ridership dwarfs femal ridership](https://github.com/bpiffard/bike-challenge/blob/main/Images/TripDurationbyGender.png)

Duration of trips does not seem to differ much by gender, though you can see that the customer base largely identifies as male.

![A piechart showing the breakdown of the customer base with male ridership ebing almost 3/4s, female ridership about 1/4 and riders of unknown ridership making up the rest](https://github.com/bpiffard/bike-challenge/blob/main/Images/GenderBreakdown.png)

Here is a clearer breakdown of the gender make-up of the customer base.

![A heatmap of bike use by hour of the day and weekday with concentrations seeming to be around common commute times](https://github.com/bpiffard/bike-challenge/blob/main/Images/TripsByHourofDay.png)

The density of bike use in the mornings and evenings supports the idea that these bikes are used primarily for commuting.

![The same type of chart as above but with multiple charts separated by gender. There seems to be little difference in concentrations outside of the fact that male ridership is by far the most concentrated](https://github.com/bpiffard/bike-challenge/blob/main/Images/TripsbyHourbyGender.png)

This trend seems consistent across gender.

![Another heat map showing concentration of ridership by weekdat, spearated by both gender and whether or not the customer is subscribed. Subscribed users have grater concentration on weekdays, while unsubscribed have higher concentration on weekends. No difference by gender outside of the much higher relative ridership in the male population](https://github.com/bpiffard/bike-challenge/blob/main/Images/TripsbyGenderbyWeekday.png)

This visualization seems to show that it is subscribed users that seem to be more likely to use bikes for commuting as opposed to the unsubscribed customers. Difference in gender likely due to ridership.

![Pie chart meant to illustrate the difference in ridership from subscribed versus unsubscribes customers. Subscribed customers dwarf unsubscribed](https://github.com/bpiffard/bike-challenge/blob/main/Images/CustomerType.png)

The number of subscribers eclipses the number uf unsubscribed customers. This as well as the reliance on commuting suggests the service has become integral to people's lives

# Summary
In conclusion, many customers seem to both be subscribed and use the bikes heavily during times typically set aside for commuting. This suggests that the individuals that us the bike-sharing service have integrated it deeply into their lives. This means that the service likealy has longevity and stability on it's side, but this does not tell us about whether or not the company is growing, or how best to help it grow. Future analysis should include the growth of subscribers over time, as well as a chart showing how long a subscriber had used the service as a guest before commiting to the service. I would also suggest a visualization showing which trips were the most popular, to get a picture on which sorts of neighborhoods are the best candidates for a bike sharing program.
