# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to anaylze Citi bank's bike sharing service in New York City. I sought to answer questions such as, how successful does it seem, who is the customer base, and how were the bikes being used?

# Results

Most rides do not last longer than an hour suggesting that these rides are for commuting reasons and not for long-distance endurance exercise

Duration of trips does not seem to differ much by gender, though you can see  that the customer base largely identifies as male

Here is a clearer breakdown of the gender make-up of the customer base

The density of bike use in the mornings and evenings supports the idea that these bikes are used primarily for commuting

This trend seems consistent across gender

This visualization seems to show that it is subscribed users that seem to be more likely to use bikes for commuting as opposed to the unsubscribed customers

The number of subscribers eclipses the number uf unsubscribed customers. This as well as the reliance on commuting suggests the service has become integral to people's lives
